# AssignmentTwoRMITaP

Major changes from Assignment one includes:
* Completely rewriting the 'driver' class into GUI controls
* Adding xml Element variables for each base class in order to a xml document
Other than that, most of the code was reuseable.

Please note: our REGEX for names allows for UNICODE 'asian' names.
